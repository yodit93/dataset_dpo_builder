It is particularly well-suited for large applications like Facebook, where performance and maintainability are critical.\n\nExample of Relay using fragments:``` graphql`\n  fragment UserComponent_user on User {\n    id\n    name\n    friends {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          id\n          name\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`;\n```"

Here’s an example of how to use it:\n\n```javascript\nfunction performIdleTask(deadline) {\n  while (deadline.timeRemaining() > 0 && idleTasks.length > 0) {\n    const task = idleTasks.shift(); // Get the next task\n    task(); // Execute the task\n  }\n\n  // If tasks remain, request another idle callback\n  if (idleTasks.length > 0) {\n    requestIdleCallback(performIdleTask);\n  }\n}\n\n// Schedule tasks to run when the browser is idle\nconst idleTasks = [\n  () => console.log('Non-critical task 1'),\n  () => console.log('Non-critical task 2'),\n  // Add more non-critical tasks here\n];\n\n// Start the idle task processing\nrequestIdleCallback(performIdleTask);\n```\n\nBy using this method, you can enhance the overall performance of your application by preventing non-critical tasks from affecting the user experience. Some tips for making the most of idle time include:\n\n1. **Prioritize and Batch Tasks**: Divide tasks into smaller chunks to avoid blocking idle time too long.\n\n2. **Set Fallback Timers**: Use a timeout to ensure tasks complete if idle time isn’t available, e.g., `{ timeout: 2000 }`.\n\n3. **Use `timeRemaining`**: Always check `deadline.timeRemaining()` to avoid affecting performance.\n\nThis approach improves performance and aligns with the RAIL model by utilizing idle periods for background processes while keeping responses, animations, and loading fast."
